# Prandtl-s-lifting-line-solution
Discretized the wing into N segments. Prandtl's lifting-line theory was used to model the system.  Included more segments for each harmonic, so as to resolve the issue of illconditioned matrix. Least square method was used to solve the matrix equation.  Bound circulation was evaluated for both elliptical and tapered wings.
